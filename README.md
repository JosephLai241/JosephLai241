My name is Joseph and I'm a self-taught software engineer from Michigan who is passionate about computer science. I am currently a software engineer at [Bluestone Analytics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CACI International, Inc][Bluestone Analytics].

I love developing in Rust and Python, and plan on implementing future projects in either (or both) languages!

### What Is URS?

URS is an open source intelligence project written in Python. It's a command-line tool that implements PRAW (the Python Reddit API Wrapper), offering users a large suite of tools to scrape various aspects of Reddit.

### What Does It Do?

Its primary scraping tools target submissions within Subreddits, Redditor profiles, and submission comments; however URS also offers the ability to stream submissions or comments created within a Subreddit or by a Redditor in real time and export that data to JSON (or not, depending on the user's preferences).

In addition to scraping tools, URS also includes analytical tools such as the word frequencies and wordcloud generators that may be used after scraping.

It allows users to export scrape data to JSON or CSV, and offers a variety of image formats when exporting wordclouds.

### How Do People Use It?

This project has been featured in various places throughout the web, including:

* Page 58 of [i-intelligence][i-intelligence]'s [September 2020 OSINT Handbook][i-intelligence OSINT Handbook]
* *Medium*'s [Week in OSINT #2019-18][Medium Week in OSINT]
* Data analysis projects, such as:
	+ [A study of how masculinity is represented through different digital platforms][Masculinity Study]
	+ [A study of how college students are handling COVID-19][COVID-19 Study]

### Future Improvements

While I believe the current suite of tools is fairly refined, the project is still a work in progress. I've already planned some enhancements for it (located in the [Future kanban][URS Future Kanban] within the repository), but I'm always looking to hear more about how it is used with the intention of adding additional enhancements that I've not considered.

### The Stack

I created a private blog implementing [React][ReactJS] for the frontend (plus [Bootstrap][Bootstrap] for styling and [Axios][Axios] for sending HTTP requests to the API), [Flask][Flask] as the API, and [MongoDB][MongoDB] as the database which holds various datasets such as blog posts and visitor information. 

# What I'm Currently Working On

URS is a project that I'm constantly maintaining.

Since my job entails lots of programming in Python, I plan on writing a majority of my future personal projects in Rust. I think it's good to know an interpreted and a compiled language well; Rust fulfills the compiled language requirement that I set for myself.
